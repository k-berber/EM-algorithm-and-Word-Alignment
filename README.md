# EM-algorithm-and-Word-Alignment
In this notebook, we examined the problem of restoring the true markup using labels from experts (whom we do not fully trust, moreover, their predictions may differ). The EM-algorithm of the model described above is implemented. Also, using the EM-algorithm, two problems are solved. The first task is to determine with the help of this corpus how each individual word is translated in the target language. The second task is to determine, for an arbitrary pair from a sentence and its translation, which word in the original sentence is each word in the target sentence translated.
